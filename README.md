# Egypt Railways API

-   Open source project I started, to solve the dilemma of booking train tickets in Egypt "the current market in Egypt does not have any platform good enough", and I use it as a practice project in my free time.

# Tech Stack on the backend

-   Typescript as main language.
-   The server is running on node.js using Express framework.
-   Postgres as main database.
-   Redis as caching database.

# Live Link
